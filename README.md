High-Performance Color-Tracking Targeting AssistantA lightweight, low-latency targeting script for Windows that utilizes screen capturing and color masking to assist with tracking. It features dedicated handling for both mouse and controller inputs.🚀 Key FeaturesLow-Level Mouse Injection: Uses ctypes.windll.user32.SendInput to provide raw-input movements that bypass many standard software-level restrictions.HSV Color Filtering: Optimized to detect strict red tones while excluding orange hues (like #ff5c23) to prevent false positives on UI elements.Dual Input Support: Monitors both Mouse (Right/Left click) and Controller (L2/R2 triggers) states to activate tracking dynamically.Dynamic FOV & Smoothing: Automatically switches between Hip-fire and ADS (Aim Down Sights) configurations for FOV and movement speed.Vertical Head Offset: Includes a configurable Y_HEAD_OFFSET to pull the aim point from center-mass toward the head/neck area.🛠️ Setup & Installation1. PrerequisitesPython 3.8+Windows OS (Admin privileges required for mouse movement)2. Install DependenciesRun the following command in your terminal:Bashpip install opencv-python numpy pywin32 keyboard pygame mss
3. UsageLaunch the script from an Administrator Command Prompt.Toggle On/Off: Press the / key on your keyboard to enable or disable the logic.Activation: The tracking will engage whenever you are holding Aim (Right Click / L2) or Firing (Left Click / R2).⚙️ Configuration constantsVariableDefaultDescriptionSMOOTH_ADS1.6The smoothness/strength while aiming down sights (Lower = Faster).Y_HEAD_OFFSET7Pixels to pull the aim upward from the detected color center.FOV_ADS80The size of the search window (in pixels) while aiming.FORCE_MULT1.4Extra speed multiplier applied only while firing.⚖️ DisclaimerThis project is for educational purposes only.
